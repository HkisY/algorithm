/**
 * Reversal of a linked list can be done recursively using a stack, but this requires O(N) extra space.
 * The following solution is similar to strategies employed in garbage collection algorithms.
 * At the top of the while loop, the list from the start to previousPos is already reversed,
 * whereas the rest of the list, from currentPos to the end is normal. This algorithm uses only constant extra space.
 * This solution reverses the list which can then be printed in reverse order.
