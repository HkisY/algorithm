/**
 * There are two obvious ways of solving this problem. One way mimics Exam34 by replacing randInt(lower, upper) with
 * (lower + upper) / 2 , This requires computing 2^{h + 1} - 1, which is not that difficult.
 * The other mimics the exam35 by noting that the heights of the subtrees are both h - 1.
